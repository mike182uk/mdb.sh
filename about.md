Hi there! I'm Mike, a fullstack software engineer ðŸ¤“ based in [Leeds, UK](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Leeds).

I'm passionate about building great technical solutions to problems using a variety of technologies, programming languages & development methodologies.

I currently work remotely for [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com), helping build [Teamwork Chat](https://www.teamwork.com/chat).

This website is a place for me to share my thoughts and experience working as a software engineer, as well as share things that I find interesting / challenging or things that may be of use to others (and my future self â˜º).

In case you missed the icons on the homepage, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}), see my open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}), see my professional profile on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }}) or check out out what I'm enjoying listening to on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/{{ site.lastfm_username }}).
